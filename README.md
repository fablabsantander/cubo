# cubo
Machine for 3D printing and laser engraving
Some members of the "FabLab Santander" have committed themselves to build the machines of the lab.
This machine is a cubic shape 3D printer with option of laser engraving.
This size of the cube is 500m.
The purpose of the design is to get a big size open source 3D printer, nice-looking, easy to build, robust with metal profiles and standart bearings (not the linear ones...).
The main design software if openscad which allow a natural integration in CVS or github software repositories.
The design is parametrized as much as possible. The elements choosen for the first version are:

- RatRig profiles
- 627 bearings
- wood/plexiglass plates
